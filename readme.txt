Notes for iteration 4:

Jourey:
- there is a duplication bug that I have been trying to figure out on the android application but I have not been able to truly get working as we wanted it tow working 
- on the list view, it seems whenever a new element has been added, then that element is duplicated amongst the elements created in the list view, causing for example, a button to be displayed 5 times if the list has 5 items in it. It is a very peculiar bug
- I have spent quite a bit of time, but no success on that end.
